# veikk-driver-config (VDCApp)

GTK+3 configuration utility for the [Veikk Linux Driver][1]

**Still in alpha development.** Use the text-based tool in the driver repo for now. CLion used for development. Make sure to have `make` and `cmake` installed.

Heavily based on the [GTK+ Building Applications tutorial][2]. Built using CLion IDE and Glade.
